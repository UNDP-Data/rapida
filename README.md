# RAPIDA ‚Äì A semi-automated geospatial analysis tool for rapid crisis response.

At it's core,**rapida** is a python library and command line tool built on top of several
curated geospatial datasets associated with specific geospatial risk's exposure components /variables
capable to perform semi-automated assessments (zonal statistics) over a specific area of interest.

Essentially, **rapida** operates with a special folder or project that contains
       
  - specific metadata in json format
  - vector data layers in [GPKG](https://gdal.org/en/stable/drivers/vector/gpkg.html) format
  - raster data in [COG](https://gdal.org/en/stable/drivers/raster/cog.html) format

A typical **rapida** session consists of following steps:

## Data sources

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **rapida** operates with public datasets. However, some of these datasets are currently being hosted in
> [GeoHub](https://geohub.data.undp.org/). This is for two main reasons. First, in case a data source is available from 
> one source only it was moved to Geohub to create a backup. Second, some data sources like population have been also 
> curated and optimized as to facilitate the assessment process.

**rapida** is about conducting geospatial assessments on  geo layers. Various properties/aspects of the layers are 
assessed or evaluated over an area of interest. The variables can be grouped into high level components that correspond
to major areas of evaluation in the context of crises like : population, built environment (buildings, roads), natural
environment (land use/cover, livestock), socio-economical environment (GDP, relative wealth index, deprivation,HDI).

<summary>
 üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Population
</summary>

Sourced from [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/) project, the components provides country based population data in 
raster format. The constrained (conditioned by buildings), UN adjusted version was selected as it was considered the best
match. As the most recent population dataset was generated for 2020 rapida is forecasting the 2025 population using 
national data from World Bank that is available for several year in the past in respect to 2020. 
From there a coefficient is computed by dividing the target or requested year (ex 2025) to 2020 and the population
statistics computed for 2020 or base year are multiplied with this coefficient.

üèôÔ∏è Built environment
</summary>

The built environment refers to the human-made surroundings that provide the setting for human activity. This includes 
all physical spaces and infrastructure constructed or significantly modified by people.



1. Buildings
---
This dataset merges Google's V3 Open Buildings, Microsoft's GlobalMLFootprints, and OpenStreetMap building footprints. 
It contains 2,705,459,584 footprints and is divided into 200 partitions. Each footprint is labelled with its respective 
source, either Google, Microsoft, or OpenStreetMap. It can be accessed in cloud-native geospatial formats such as 
GeoParquet, FlatGeobuf and PMTiles.

So far two spatial variables have been defined: the **number of buildings** per polygon to assess and the cumulative
**area of buildings** per polygon to assess.

2. Electrical grid
---

This dataset provides a global-scale, high-resolution predictive map of medium- and low-voltage electricity distribution
networks. Developed using open-source geospatial data, satellite imagery, and machine learning models, it fills critical
data gaps in power infrastructure‚Äîparticularly in underserved or data-poor regions. The dataset supports energy access 
planning, infrastructure development, and policymaking.


The distribution network layout was estimated using predictive modeling based on spatial features such as 
**population density, proximity to existing infrastructure, land use, and OpenStreetMap data**. 
Models were trained and validated using empirical data from 14 countries, achieving ~75% accuracy. 
The resulting dataset includes both observed and predicted network lines and is suitable for global energy planning and 
accessibility/assessment  studies.




3. Roads
---

The GRIP dataset provides a globally harmonized vector map of road infrastructure, integrating over 21 million kilometers
of roads from a variety of open and commercial sources. Designed to support global-scale environmental and accessibility modeling, 
the dataset offers standardized road classifications and extensive geographic coverage, especially in previously underrepresented regions.

Road data were compiled from national, regional, and global datasets, harmonized into a unified schema, and cleaned for 
spatial consistency. Next, they were classified into five standardized types (e.g., highways, primary, secondary, local, tracks) 
and validated using satellite imagery and supplementary datasets. The dataset is suitable for applications 
targeting land-use modeling, biodiversity impact assessments, and sustainable development planning.

<summary>
üåæ Landuse
</summary>

While conceptually simple, this layer features several characteristics that make its usage and applications
difficult to interpret. Typically, land use layer is produced using  middle to high resolution 
satellite imagery that is generated by taking snapshots of earth at particular instances of space and time. Next, imagery tiles
that fulfill specific requirements are merged together into a seamless, spatially contiguous dataset.
This brings a large amount of heterogeneity into the processing and interpretation of land use layer because various 
pixels that compose it have been acquired at and different times and under different conditions.

In the context of crisis resilience, the timing of satellite image acquisition is critical. Imagery captured before, after, 
or both before and after a specific event is typically used to assess conditions on the ground. In case of land use layer 
this is problematic because neighbour location could be acquired at different instances of time and conditions and bear little resemblance or
positive spatial auto-correlation. 
As a result, **rapida** employes a different approach. Cloud accessible Sentinel 2 L1C imagery, available at global level
is fed into the [Google dynamic world model](https://github.com/google/dynamicworld) to predict land use in close to real time
for every image selected in a specific time interval with less than 5% cloud coverage. 

The last step that is to generate the cloud prediction  and use the layer to mask/out filter
cloudy/snowy pixels. There are various algorithms can detect clouds from Sentinel 2 images as described in [Skakun et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.112990), 
Rapida tool uses [s2cloudless](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinel2-cloud-detector) as a cloud detection algorithm incorporating with landuse component.
If image contains more than or equal to one percent of cloud, cloud detection and masking are applied to the land use image.

> **Note**
> Predicting land use in close to real time is a computationally demanding task and should be treated with care

Land use component data processing flow is illustrated in the below diagram.

üí∞ Socio-economic environment
</summary>

The socio-economic environment refers to the social and economic conditions that influence and shape the lives, 
behaviors, and development outcomes of individuals, communities, and societies.

1. Deprivation
---
The Global Gridded Relative Deprivation Index (GRDI), Version 1, provides a detailed picture of relative deprivation and 
poverty worldwide, mapped at a high spatial resolution of approximately 1 km¬≤. The index ranges from 0 (least deprived) 
to 100 (most deprived). It is built using a combination of demographic and satellite data, carefully processed to ensure
consistency across different regions. To create GRDI, six key factors were selected to represent different aspects of 
deprivation, such as economic activity, child mortality, and human development. The dataset covers the entire globe, 
integrating the best available data at either a fine-scale grid level or broader administrative boundaries.

GRDI combines six key indicators to assess deprivation levels:

1. Built-up Area Ratio (BUILT): Measures the proportion of land covered by buildings compared to open land. Lower values
    indicate higher deprivation, as rural areas tend to have fewer economic opportunities.¬π
2. Child Dependency Ratio (CDR): The number of children (aged 0‚Äì14) per 100 working-age adults (15‚Äì64). 
   A higher ratio suggests higher deprivation due to greater economic strain on households.¬≤
3. Infant Mortality Rate (IMR): The number of infant deaths (under one year old) per 1,000 live births. 
   A higher IMR indicates poorer health conditions and higher deprivation.
4. Subnational Human Development Index (SHDI): A local version of the Human Development Index (HDI), considering education,
health, and living standards. Lower SHDI scores reflect higher deprivation.¬≥
5. Nighttime Lights (VNL, 2020): Measures light intensity at night, which is often linked to economic activity and infrastructure. 
   Areas with less artificial light tend to have higher deprivation.‚Å¥
6. Nighttime Lights Trend (VNL Slope, 2012‚Äì2020): Tracks changes in nighttime lights over time. 
   A decline in brightness suggests worsening deprivation, while an increase indicates economic growth.

The dataset can be used to:
- identify areas with high deprivation to guide poverty reduction efforts
- map socioeconomic inequalities at fine spatial scales
- support policy decisions and resource allocation for targeted interventions


2. Relative Wealth Index
---
The Meta Relative Wealth Index is a high-resolution, machine learning‚Äìderived proxy for household wealth, developed by 
Meta‚Äôs Data for Good initiative. It estimates relative wealth scores at a 2.4 km grid level across low- and middle-income 
countries by analyzing de-identified Facebook connectivity data and satellite imagery. 
The RWI enables fine-scale economic analysis in data-scarce regions and supports humanitarian, development, and policy interventions.




3. GDP
___
This dataset provides annual, global gridded estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at 0.1¬∞ spatial resolution (~10 km at the equator)
from 2015 to 2100, fully aligned with the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). 
It offers GDP values in both constant 2015 U.S. dollars and purchasing power parity (PPP), enabling spatially explicit 
long-term economic modeling under diverse socioeconomic scenarios.
The dataset was up-sampled to 1km resolution and reprojected to [EPSG:3857](https://epsg.io/3857) to facilitate web usage.

To construct a spatially explicit and globally consistent GDP dataset aligned with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), 
the authors began by collecting national-level GDP projections for each of the five SSP scenarios. These projections, 
expressed in both constant 2015 U.S. dollars and purchasing power parity (PPP), were sourced from authoritative institutions 
such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Institute for 
Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). 

Next, population data at 0.1¬∞ resolution were obtained from the SSP Public Database. 
These gridded population distributions were used as the basis for disaggregating national GDP values. 
The key assumption underpinning the downscaling process was that GDP per capita remains spatially uniform within each 
country for a given year. Based on this, national GDP totals were allocated across grid cells in direct proportion to the
local population count. This method produced a high-resolution, annual global GDP dataset spanning from 2015 to 2100, 
consistent with the spatial and temporal dynamics of each SSP scenario. 
The resulting data are well-suited for use in integrated assessment models, climate impact studies, land-use modeling, and other applications requiring detailed socioeconomic projections.

## Installation using pip

rapida builds on several open source geospatial packages and has a relative large dependency tree with several native ones
like GDAL and this ads complexity to the installation procedure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend installing into a virtual environment as opposed toi install into the default python interpreter/system


___
1. ensure GDAL libs and binary tools are available on your system. On linux this can be done using:
```commandline
    gdalinfo --version
```
2. create the virtual env suing tools/mean of your choice. Here there are two options
   1. create a virtual end that includes system packages
   ```commandline
   pipenv --python 3 --system-packages
   ```
    2. create a clean virtual end and install GDAL
   ```commandline
   pipenv --python 3
   GDAL_VERSION=$(gdalinfo --version | grep -oP 'GDAL \K[0-9.]+')
   echo $GDAL_VERSION
   pipenv run pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall --no-binary=gdal gdal==$GDAL_VERSION
   pipenv run pip list
    Package Version
    ------- -------
    GDAL    3.8.4
    pip     25.0.1

   ```
3. install rapida from github
   1. with git binaries available
      ```commandline
         pipenv run pip install git+https://github.com/UNDP-Data/rapida.git
      ```
      2. without git binaries
      ```commandline
      pipenv  run pip install https://github.com/UNDP-Data/rapida/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
      ```

4. test the installation
```commandline
pipenv run rapida 
Usage: rapida [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  UNDP Crisis Bureau Rapida tool.

  This command line tool is designed to assess various geospatial variables
  representing exposure and vulnerability aspects of geospatial risk induced
  by natural hazards.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  init      initialize RAPIDA tool
  auth      authenticate with UNDP account
  admin     fetch administrative boundaries at various levels from OSM/OCHA
  create    create a RAPIDA project in a new folder
  assess    assess/evaluate a specific geospatial exposure
            components/variables
  list      list RAPIDA projects/folders located in default Azure file share
  download  download a RAPIDA project from Azure file share
  upload    upload a RAPIDA project to Azure file share
  publish   publish RAPIDA project results to Azure and GeoHub
  delete    delete a RAPIDA project from Azure file share

```


## Installation using Docker on Linux/Mac

rapida can be deployed as a docker container and with some shell scripting be used effectively
on a local machine as a command line tool. 

1. ensure docker is installed and working. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Avoid installing docker from snap even if it is convenient. snap docker has some
>  specific restrictions (mount home folder, etc.)
```commandline
    docker --version
```
2. create rapida  docker based launcher

```bash
# 1. Write the script to a temporary file
cat <<'EOF' > /tmp/rapida
#!/usr/bin/bash

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  command="rapida"
else
  command="$1"
  shift # Remove the command from the arguments if present
fi
VERSION="main"
timestamp=$(date +%s)
docker run --rm -it \
  -u 1000:1000 \
  --name rapida$timestamp \
  -m 32GB \
  --cpus 8 \
  -e GDAL_NUM_THREADS=8 \
  -w $PWD \
  -v $PWD:$PWD \
  -v /home:/home \
  -v /data:/data \
  -v /tmp:/tmp \
  ghcr.io/undp-data/rapida:$VERSION \
  $command "$@"
EOF

# 2. Move it to /usr/local/bin
sudo mv /tmp/rapida /usr/local/bin/rapida

# 3. Make it executable
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rapida


```

**rapida** docker image is based on ghcr.io/osgeo/gdal:ubuntu-small-$VERSION. This is an ubuntu based image with
a non-root ubuntu user (1000:1000) and featuring bash shell. 
The above launcher script ensures that rapida tool installed inside the container can be executed form the local host like
any regular command.

3. test the installation
```commandline
pipenv run rapida 
Usage: rapida [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  UNDP Crisis Bureau Rapida tool.

  This command line tool is designed to assess various geospatial variables
  representing exposure and vulnerability aspects of geospatial risk induced
  by natural hazards.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  init      initialize RAPIDA tool
  auth      authenticate with UNDP account
  admin     fetch administrative boundaries at various levels from OSM/OCHA
  create    create a RAPIDA project in a new folder
  assess    assess/evaluate a specific geospatial exposure
            components/variables
  list      list RAPIDA projects/folders located in default Azure file share
  download  download a RAPIDA project from Azure file share
  upload    upload a RAPIDA project to Azure file share
  publish   publish RAPIDA project results to Azure and GeoHub
  delete    delete a RAPIDA project from Azure file share

```

There are several key parameters in the launcher that ensure this process is successful:

- rapida is installed as non-root in a virtual env created by pipenv and made available in the container as a regular script
- the container is run with local logged in linux user using -u 1000:1000
- the USER env variable is used in Jupyter lab server to pass user identification name to rapida to store the auth file in signed in user folder. However, it is not necessary to set this variable apart from Jupyter environment.
- rapida is a project based tool that requires the command to be invoked from within the folder. The current user folder
 is always passed inside the container as the current working folder using -w flag
- the /home folder is mounted to persist the config files between invoking multiple sessions
- the timestamp ensures multiple projects can be assessed at the same time by ensuring every run creates a container with
  a unique name


## Installation on Windows in a virtual environment

Similar to Linux, the installation of rapida on Windows depends on the availability of native
binaries like GDAL or exactextract.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When deciding to install GDAL one needs to consider several aspects related to versioning.

| **GDAL Version** | **Compatible Python Versions**     |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| 3.8+             | Python 3.8 ‚Äì 3.12 (varies by build)|

       REM Get current directory and convert Windows path to WSL path
       set "CWD=%cd%"
    
       REM Extract drive letter (e.g. C:) and convert to lowercase (e.g. c)
       set "DRIVE_LETTER=%CWD:~0,1%"

       set "DRIVE_LETTER=!DRIVE_LETTER:E=e!"
       set "DRIVE_LETTER=!DRIVE_LETTER:F=f!"
       REM Add more drives if needed
    
       REM Remove drive letter and colon from path

       echo Using WSL path: !WSL_PATH!
       echo Mounting home: !WSL_USERPROFILE!
       echo Mounting temp: !WSL_TEMP!
    
       REM Run Docker container
    
       docker run --rm -it --name rapida!TIMESTAMP! -m 2GB --cpus 1 -e GDAL_NUM_THREADS=2 -w "!WSL_PATH!" -v "!WSL_USERPROFILE!":/home ghcr.io/undp-data/rapida:main rapida %*
    
       endlocal
       ``` 
       * save the following code as ***rapida.bat*** and place it somewhere in the %PATH

       * invoke rapida tool script.
   
       This will download the rapida tool docker image and launch it as 
       a container passing all arguments to the tool running  inside
